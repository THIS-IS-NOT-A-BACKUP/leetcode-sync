# LeetCode Sync

GitHub Action for automatically syncing LeetCode submissions to a GitHub repository.

## Features

- Syncs accepted solutions from LeetCode to the default branch of the GitHub repo
- Only syncs solutions that have not been synced before
- Uploads the latest accepted solution for a single problem if there are multiple submissions per day

## How to use

1. Login to LeetCode and obtain the `csrftoken` and `LEETCODE_SESSION` cookie values.

   - After logging in, right-click on the page and press `Inspect`.
   - Refresh the page.
   - Look for a network request to https://leetcode.com.
   - Look under `Request Headers` for the `cookie:` attribute to find the values.

2. Create a new GitHub repository to host the LeetCode submissions.

   - It can be either private or public.

3. Add the values from step 1 as [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository),
   e.g. `LEETCODE_CSRF_TOKEN` and `LEETCODE_SESSION`.

4. Add a workflow file with this action under the `.github/workflows` directory, e.g. `sync_leetcode.yml`.

   Example workflow file:

   ```yaml
   name: Sync Leetcode

   on:
     workflow_dispatch:
     schedule:
       - cron: "0 8 * * 6"

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - name: Sync
           uses: joshcai/leetcode-sync@v1.4
           with:
             github-token: ${{ github.token }}
             leetcode-csrf-token: ${{ secrets.LEETCODE_CSRF_TOKEN }}
             leetcode-session: ${{ secrets.LEETCODE_SESSION }}
             destination-folder: my-folder
   ```

5. After you've submitted a LeetCode solution, run the workflow by going to the `Actions` tab, clicking the action name, e.g. `Sync Leetcode`, and then clicking `Run workflow`. The workflow will also automatically run once a week by default (can be configured via the `cron` parameter).

## Inputs

- `github-token` _(required)_: The GitHub access token for pushing solutions to the repository
- `leetcode-csrf-token` _(required)_: The LeetCode CSRF token for retrieving submissions from LeetCode
- `leetcode-session` _(required)_: The LeetCode session value for retrieving submissions from LeetCode
- `filter-duplicate-secs`: Number of seconds after an accepted solution to ignore other accepted solutions for the same problem, default: 86400 (1 day)
- `destination-folder` _(optional)_: The folder in your repo to save the submissions to (necessary for shared repos)

## Shared Repos

A single repo can be shared by multiple users by using the `destination-folder` input field to sync each user's files to a separate folder. This is useful for users who want to add a more social, collaborative, or competitive aspect to their LeetCode sync repo.

## FAQ

#### Job fails with "HttpError: API rate limit exceeded for installation ID \<id\>"

This likely means that you hit a rate limit when committing to GitHub (this may happen if you have over ~300 submissions initially). Since the syncer writes in reverse chronological order, it should pick up syncing submissions from where it left off on the next run of the workflow, so just retry the workflow manually after some time.
